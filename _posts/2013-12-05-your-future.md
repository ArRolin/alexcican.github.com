I recently installed a browser plugin called “Rather”. Its function is very basic and superficial: it replaces content (words) you don’t want to see with something else.

Whilst you’re browsing Twitter, a tweet with the word “Kardashians” pops up? Block it and show kittens drinking milk instead. Don’t like the site 9gag.com? Block the entire domain “9gag.com/(.*)”.
It’s a neat tool that allows me, to some extent, to personalise my browsing experience.

A couple of weeks ago I browsed a big video content website for the first time. The amount of video thumbnails they had on their homepage overwhelmed me, so I closed my browser tab. The mistake they did was that they didn’t personalise their website for first-time users.

## Towards a more personalised future
The Internet started as basic pages linked together. Back then, the Internet revolved around information and content: static websites, weblogs, forums. After that, it moved to platforms which allowed you to create your digital persona for others to see: MySpace, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, etc. And in the near future, the Internet will morph into a giant mirror—whichever platform you visit, you will see yourself: the things you like (and won’t see things you dislike).

I visit YouTube almost daily not because of the cat videos or the latest popular video of Miley Cyrus swinging from a wrecking ball, but thanks to my subscriptions to people whom I like watching their videos. YouTube got that, and it’s displaying those videos on “my” homepage:

I’m making a case that it’s no longer even about connections, a.k.a. the old “see what my friends are up to”—we’re past that. If I don’t *like* what my high school buddy posts, I can hide, unfollow, block, and remove them from my digital view. It’s becoming purely about the things *I* like and dislike.

Take the lack of personalisation on the BBC’s website, for example. This was their homepage some days ago:

Why is the first story I see on their site about the Latvian PM who quit? Am I living in Latvia? The last time I checked I was located in Cyprus. How hard is it to implement a geolocation mechanism that shows me the news from my country first?

Same deal with the weather section on the right: “Wow, it’s 11˚ C?! Wait, no it’s not—I’m not in London”. My browser knows my location, why dear BBC website are you so stupid? Oh, you want me to type-in my location? In what format? City, City-Country, Country-City, ZIP code, Lat-Long, Google Maps link? Imagine how much more traffic they could’ve gotten if they at least did the weather section right. I would visit their site just to get info about the weather.

“Pff, personalisation… big deal! Wow, Alex, you’re a genius…not.” I hear you say. Bear with me, whilst I take you a trip through the wormhole (narrated by Morgan Freeman, of course).

## Enter the wormhole
The alarm on your phone wakes you up gently, and you feel well-rested. During the night, your phone tracked your sleep and calculated during which sleep cycle to wake you up. It wakes you up by playing your favourite song from yesterday (you had it on repeat for half an hour).

After you’re turned off the alarm, your phone starts dictating to you the latest local news (news only on the topics you like), local weather, emails/messages/comments you got from the group of your favourite people, and your schedule for the day. Using proximity sensors, when you go to the bathroom, the information continues streaming to your bathroom’s speakers via Bluetooth LE.

Your phone knows that on Tuesdays you like to spend some time at the bookstore before going to work. 

The car automatically switches to radio stations that only play your favourite songs and genres.

At work, whilst you’re walking through the lobby, that colleague you always avoid having a conversation with, is walking towards your way. Your phone knows you dislike that person and generates a fake call so it looks like someone is calling you. Success evasion from an awkward conversation once again! At around 11 you usually have a small coffee break. You get a notification that the bagels you like are back in stock at the bakery near your workplace. Whilst you’re there you should try their new blueberry muffin that you’ll love, because you like muffins, and it’s 20% off just today. 

It’s time to head home. You hop in your car, and your phone suggests an alternative route to take so you can get home faster. You get an alert to stop for gas whilst you’re approaching your favourite gas station (number of times you bought gas from there). You’re friends with the owner, so you pop in to say a quick “Hi”. “News about Mikey” you dictate, and your phone informs you about the most important event update from Mikey—he just got a dog a couple of days ago! You go in and have an engaging conversation with Mikey. 

Phone no SIM. No lost numbers

Go out. Automatic ordering of drinks. Meet girls. Common interests/friends.

You place your phone on the bar table and it charges wirelessly, thanks to the conductive material. When you leave the bar, the tab is automatically split and paid by your mobile. If you’re feeling generous, you merge the tabs and pay for all the drinks.

Because you’ve had a bit too much to drink, you should take a cab. You select your destination (home), and the phone comes up with available taxi cars nearby your location and displays their fare. Once you’ve selected one, the driver gets a notification and if he accepts it, he comes and picks you up from where you’re waiting. The cab driver already has your destination (home) in their GPS. The cab fare is paid automatically once you’ve arrived at the destination (and exiting the cab).
